00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.920
Goth is many things. It's a Germanic

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.800
tribe, a style of architecture, a type of

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.480
literature, of film. It's a youth

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.360
movement. What ties most of these things

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.280
together is a sense of dark romanticism.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.360
But despite Marilyn Manson and My

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.320
Chemical Romance being infamous for their

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.840
adoption of Gothic fashion. Their music

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.760
isn't what would traditionally be

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.720
classified as goth. To quote Sasha Geffen

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.200
of Pitchfork, goth songs were marked by

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.920
echoes, distortion, minimal guitar

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280
lines, and an arched taste for the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.040
macabre. Their electroshocked hair,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.680
smears of black eyeliner and dark clothes

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.680
only reinforced the vibe. So

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.400
while any youth dressed in black with a

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.680
fondness for obvious makeup can be dubbed

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.320
goth doesn't mean that they listen to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.160
goth music. That is a separate

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.240
thing with its own Sonic template.
